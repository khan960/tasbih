# Optimizing Website Performance with Social Media Embeds  

## Overview  
[https://tasbihdigital.net/](https://tasbihdigital.net/) is a website that integrates embedded social media content, including X (formerly Twitter) feeds and share buttons. While the integration functions well on most browsers, we’ve observed slower performance on Firefox, particularly on Windows systems.  

This repository is dedicated to exploring optimization techniques and solutions to improve the performance of embedded social media content, ensuring a smooth user experience across all browsers.  

## Objective  
The goal is to:  
1. Identify performance bottlenecks caused by embedded scripts (e.g., X embeds).  
2. Optimize page loading times, focusing on Firefox and Windows environments.  
3. Share best practices and solutions with the developer community.  

## Challenges  
- Slower page load times on Firefox compared to other browsers.  
- Performance issues with pages containing embedded X content.  
- Potential OS-level or browser-specific factors impacting performance.  

## Contributions  
We welcome:  
- Insights into similar issues and how you’ve resolved them.  
- Open-source tools or libraries that aid in debugging or optimization.  
- Suggestions for improving website performance for Firefox users.
